# **UX** 

## **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Grape Escape-WWOOFers experience target users are:

-	Aged 18-70
-	First time and veteran WWOOFers
-	People interested in having a better understanding of  organic and self-sufficient lifestyles
-	Have an interest in visiting the Torsi villa

What these users would be looking for:

-	Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
-	Beautiful photos that provide a positive response and make the destinations look desirable
-	Helpful guidance on what to expect once at the villa

This website allows intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. It purposely does not provide overwhelming amounts of information that could put off first time WWOOFers.

As it is assumed that most WWOOFers will be using their mobile whilst travelling, the design of the website is responsive to small and medium screens too.

## **Scope**

To achieve the desired user and business goals, I’ve included the following features will be included in this release:
-	Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
-	Gallery of images from previous volunteers at the villa
-	Get started form for enquiries
-	Links to affiliate social media pages

What I would like to add in the future:
-	A FAQs page to let the user have extra information 

## **Structure**
This is a three-page website to allow for desired flow;
 The navigation bar would include the links to all three pages and will allow the user to easily move through the website.

 I chose the following order for the information 
 'Home >Gallery> Get Started'
 as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. 
 
 The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. 
 
 Finally, there is a simple Get Started form that allows the user to send their enquiries to Grape Escape team, with a choice of some selected topics to choose from.

## **Skeleton**
[Wireframes]()
I had originally thought about creating a website with a homepage and 3 separate pages by adding a FAQs section, yet I later decided not to proceed this way to avoid cognitive overload by displaying too much information. 

Please note the finalised website contains slight variations to the original wireframe.

I purposely placed the Gallery anchor element as a last thing in the home page to encourage users to click on it and receive a positive response from the images shown in the gallery.

## **Surface**
I’ve chosen a colour palette based around orange & greens from the hero image. 

I would like the users of this website to have a positive response and to be transported in an atmosphere of nature and I believe the orange from the sunset and the green from the vineyard will help with this. 

I paired these two colours with a lighter off-beige to allow for appropriate contrast.

I used Google fonts Barlow semi condensed and Yanone Kafeesats across the entire website. 
I felt that the two fonts  could be a good pairing .'Barlow semi condensed' was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easier to read for the large blocks of texts which is why I've choses 'Yanone Kafeesats' for the body text.

## **Features**
All of the headings use the font ‘Barlow semi condensed’ whilst the body text use Yanone Kafeesatz, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; each page is accessible through the nav bar. 

### *Navbar*
The navbar is placed on top of a colorful header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to stick at the top to allow better navigation through the website.

The image I have chosen is representative of the site's theme and incorporates the colour palette, it immediately encourages the user to think of being on holiday and increase their curiosity about Villa Torsi

### *What is WWOOFing section*
I've decided to add a simple explanation of what WWOOFing is – to target first time users and prompt some curiosity and interest in them. 

I kept the layout and style of this section very basic to avoid cognitive overload.

### *About Us section*
In here the user will find a brief explanation of what to expect from such experience and from the host itself. 

I’ve used some h2 headings, followed by a representative image of the descriptive content of the paragraphs that follows. I wanted to keep this section simple, clean and straight to the point as a FAQs page will later be added.

![image of Grape Escape About us section](/docs/images/about-us-section.jpg)

### *Gallery page*
This page features a simple structure of three images per row, for a total of twelve images- with some feedbacks and reviews from the guests in the picture. The idea for a future version of this website that the images will keep on been updated and will keep on changing. 

This layout had been chosen to provide the user with a positive reaction and possibly imagine themselves among the people in the pictures.  

To help the users to easily navigate their way beyond this page, the header and the footer are consistent with the home page.

![image of Grape Escape Gallery page](/docs/images/gallery-feedbacks.jpg)

### *Get started page*
This is a signup form that will allow the user to send enquiries and get in touch with the Grape Escape team. 

The form uses 5 elements, 2 text inputs and an email input, plus a drop-down menu to select the nature of the enquiry and a textbox to let the users express themselves. 
They are all required therefore all information is necessary to submit the form. 

Some heading and paragraph had been added in this page with further explanation of the reason I’ve decided not to include the location of the farm. 

A background image coherent with the style of the whole website had been chosen for this page for consistency really, and the form had been adapted with the right contrast to avoid readability issue.

![image of Grape Escape Get Started page](/docs/images/get-started-page.jpg)

A last paragraph mentions a FAQs page – not yet created! – that will allow the user to gather more information whilst waiting for a reply to their enquiry.

### *Enquiry-received*
This page will conferm the user that the enquiry has indeed been sent and that a member of the team will reply to them as soon as possible.
The layout and style of this page is coherent with the rest of the website, so is the background image i've used.

![image confirming that an enquiry has been sent and surely received by Grape Escape team](/docs/images/enquiry-sent.jpg)


### *Footer*
The footer is coherent with the layout and style of the header and nav bar; at this time it only includes links to social media pages ,all of them opening in a new tab to facilitate the user navigation.

### **HTML and CSS Validation**

After fixing some errors on both testing sites- maynli some typos but also some unnecessary sections in index.html or style elements in style.css , the site eventually passed the W3C Validation.

### **Color Contrast Validator**
The initial color of logo content had poor Contrast Ratio of 3.52 with the background. So I changed it to a darker green and a darker orange, and i've also slightly changed the opacity of the background color. 

The Color Contrast Accessibility Validator was used to test for colour contrast on the project.

### **Deployment**
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. For the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://silviasaverino.github.io/Grape-Escape-WWOOFing-Experience/ into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.

My project was developed using the IDE, Gitpod. I deployed my website from the GitHub repository to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. I selected the Settings tab in my GitHub repository.
![Step1 step to deploy a project on Github](/docs/images/deployment1.png)

2. I located the GitHub Pages section and chose the Master branch as the source to enable GitHub Pages. 
![Step2 to deploy a project on Github](/docs/images/deployment2.png)

3. Once I saved the Master Branch as the source, the page refreshed and I located the URL to the deployed website.
