                What is WWOOFing?
            </h2>
            <p> WWOOFing stands for "World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms".<br>The volunteer or wwoofer gets the
                opportunity to spend time in an organic farm, learn what it's like, how it works and what sustainable
                agriculture is all about.</p>
            <p>
                During your stay in the farm<br>- alongside wwoofers from other Countries and with visits ranging from a
                few days to several months - <br>the host will provide accommodation and opportunities to learn about
                organic and self-sufficient lifestyles;<br> in returns of an average of four to six hours farming or
                gardening activities.</p>
            <p>
                Please, note this is not a monetary exchange program, but merely an educational one.
                <br>

                <p>The Torsi family villa was built in the 1870, originally on a land of just 50 yards with just couple
                    of olives trees and a small barn at the back. Today this stunning villa comprises all the
                    commodities of the 21st century as well as some original features too.
                </p>

                    Accommodation will be
                    provided across its 12rooms to all of our lovely guests grape-escaping from the city buzz and a
                    frenetic lifestyle, or willing to join us to simply enjoy some good wine and time in the Italian
                    countryside.

                    friendships with the other guests along the way.</p>

                <p>Between grape harvesting sessions you will be able to enjoy morning coffee, Italian pastries,
                    charcuteries, wine tasting and wine pairing with some of the best organic product and regional
                    delicatessen,<br>
                    plus weekends excursions in the nearby cities, villages and more.

                <p>Either as a beginner or a Wwoofing veteran all that the Torsi family wishes for you is to have a
                    great time and get involved in their small community to really capture the essence of this beautiful
                    Italian region, whilst learning about grape harvesting and wine </p>

                <p>Although we won't hide that nowadays the Villa needs some extra love and attention, and we will gratefully welcome little
                    renovation works from any volunteers that wish to do so.
